# CHANGELOG

## Version 11303.01

- Added 1.13.3 support;
- Added BeautyCase-like skin;
- Gold toast's icon now has three states: copper, bronze, and gold;
- Updated Korean translation. Translated by blacknib@Curse;
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.

NOTE: You'll have to restart WoW client to make things work after the update.

## Version 11302.02

- Renamed "Loot (Common)" to "Loot (Items)". There's no special loot toasts in Classic, so previous  
  name made little sense.

## Version 11302.01

- Release released.
