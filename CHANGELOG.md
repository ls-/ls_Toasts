# CHANGELOG

## Version 30402.01

- Added 3.4.2 support.
- Added "Two Tone" variants to all built-in skins. They have a two tone background that's similar to that of Blizz
  achievement toasts. I might tweak the textures depending on the feedback.
- Updated Spanish translation. Translated by Shacoulrophobia@Curse.

## Version 30401.01

- Added 3.4.1 support.
- Updated French translation. Translated by Braincell1980@Curse.
- Updated German translation. Translated by MrKimab@Curse.
- Updated Traditional Chinese translation. Translated by RainbowUI@Curse.

## Version 30400.03

- Fixed file loading order.

## Version 30400.02

- Added an option to show poor quality quality items via common loot toasts. Thanks to Faqar@GitHub.
- Added leaf ornaments to achievement toasts. I can't re-enable Blizz achievement toasts, so as a
  compromise I chose to make achievement toasts more unique. If you want them to stand out even more
  create a separate anchor to display them.
- Added new "Info" panel to the config. It has links to various resourced including my Discord
  server dedicated to LS: * addons.
- Fixed corrupt beautycase border texture. It worked, but baked-in shadows were messed up.
- Updated Traditional Chinese translation. Translated by BNS333@Curse.
